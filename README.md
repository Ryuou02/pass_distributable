<h1>Program Assistant (pass)</h1>
This is a program made specifically just to get things done. To use this program, having knowledge about command prompt and usage of command prompt is recommended however, I have designed it so that even without knowing all that, you can use *most* of the functionality.

if you directly want the compiled program, it is available in the x64\Release\directory

place the .exe file in your \Windows or \Windows\System32 directory so that you can call it using "pass" command on command prompt or powershell

pass will be made for Linux distributions in future
